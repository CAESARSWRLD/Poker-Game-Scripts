Here is the poker program so far. It's currently pretty unintuitive and 
annoying to work with but I'm working on organizing the game logic to 
make it more wieldy. Initially my thought process was that the main game loop
could be somewhat messy and I can have fun and try not to be a perfectionist, but as
I make more progress I need to consider how difficult it'll be to add networking on 
top of what I currently have. 

I've included too much code in this CardActions.cs file so I'll have to re-organize 
at some point to make it more readable and easy to work with for others or myself in 
the future of course. However, I don't plan on outsourcing any work.

So far I have buttons and players take turns making their move using the buttons. After that the 
next player at the table gets to make their move. There is not yet a board 
of cards that come out after players make their actions.
